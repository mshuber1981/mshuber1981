            <p>
              I enlisted in the United States Coast Guard during my last year of
              High School to take advantage of the GI Bill. It was a challenging
              adventure that also helped pay for college.

              Everyone said I needed to go so I went. The GI Bill helped pay for
              most of it. I started at Des Moines Area Community college and
              finished my journey with a Bachelor of Science in Finance from
              Iowa State University.

            <h4>2007 - Financial Crisis</h4>
            <p>
              I graduated in December of 2007. The irony of my chosen major
              would soon be front and center. This was a tuff time for myself
              and a lot of other people. I survived and ended up going back to
              Des Moines Area Community college to learn more about the world of
              Information Technology. I had high hopes of a livable wage and a
              higher standard of living ahead.

            <h4>2011 - Corporate America</h4>
            <p>
              I finally lucked out and got my first IT job. I started as a
              contractor, ascended to the ranks of actual employee after a year,
              and got my first promotion after another year. Eventually the
              parent company decided to outsource everything related to IT.
              Along the way I survived a hectic merger followed by the spin-off
              of a new company. In the beginning I felt valued and learned a
              lot, but twoard the end I was always worried about losing my job
              and I felt like I needed to make a change.

            <h4>2018 - Making changes and taking chances</h4>
            <p>
              I thought my job was in jepordy and I was tired of living in fear.
              I did the best I could to find a suitable replacement but it ended
              up being a step in the wrong direction. After lifting and shifting
              my life to Red Wing, Minnesota I wanted to find a way to make my
              new job work, but it was just not a good fit for me. I ended up
              resigning, selling almost everything I owned, and retreating back
              to Iowa.

            <h4>2019 - The Pandemic</h4>

              What an interesting time for all of us. I spent my first year at
              home sheltering in place and learning everything I could about
              Amazon Web Services. I got some AWS exposure before I left Corteva
              Agriscience. Cloud native application developement was a hot topic
              and I was genuinely interested.
